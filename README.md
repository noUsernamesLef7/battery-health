# battery-health
A super simple bash script that logs the upower battery capacity percentage to a text file when run. I run it at startup as well as when the charger is plugged in or removed. 

Output is the current date and time when run followed by a '-' followed by the battery capacity percentage. This is a measure of how healthy the battery is, derived from the percentage of the maximum designed capacity that is still available.
